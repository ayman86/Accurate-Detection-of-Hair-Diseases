# Accurate-Detection-of-Hair-Diseases
The proposed approach can reliably identify hair disorders. We constructed the classification model using a Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (LWCNN), which enables the automatic extraction of features in an end-to-end fashion. Compared to other methods that widely used like ResNet-18, and SqueezeNet.
